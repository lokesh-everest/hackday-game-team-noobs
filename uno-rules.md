## Game components

4 suits of cards (Blue / Green / Red / Yellow)

For each suit, there are:
  - 19 cards numbered 0-9 (2x 1-9, + 1x 0)
  - 2 x skip card
  - 2 x reverse card
  - 2 x draw 2 card

Additionally, there are some WILD suit cards:
  - 4 x wild cards
  - 4 x wild draw 4 cards

## Game setup
- the game is played in rounds
- at the start of each round, all the cards are shuffled together
- each player is given 7 cards at random from the deck (these are no longer in the deck)
- the remaining cards are placed face down on the "table" as a "draw pile"
- the top card of the "draw pile" is placed next to it as the first of the "discard" pile.
  - if the first card is a WILD suit card, return it randomly into the deck and another card is picked
  - card [special rules](#special%20rules) still apply to the "first player" first turn
  - this card is the "top card"

## Gameplay
- 1 player is designated as "first player". This role rotates through players in order of joining the game, at the start of each round
- players take their ["turn"](#turn) in order of joining the game, starting with "first player"
- game play continues until the first person runs out of cards

## Turn
- Each turn, the current player MUST play a card that:
  - is the same colour as the "top card", or
  - is the same number as the "top card", or
  - play any wild card in their hand (if allowed*)
- If no card can be played, the player MUST draw a card from the "draw pile"
  - if that card can be played, they MAY play it (could be automatic?)


## special rules

- **Skip**: The next person in line to play after this card is played loses his/her turn and is "skipped".
- **Reverse**: This card reverses direction of play. Play to the left now passes to the right, and vice versa.
- **Draw 2**: next person to play must draw 2 cards and forfeit his/her turn.
- **Wild card**: Whoever plays this card can choose to play it as any colour (including the colour of the "top card")
- **Wild draw 4**: Whoever plays this card can:
  -  choose to play it as any colour (including the colour of the current "top card")
  -  requires the next player to draw 4 cards from the "draw pile" and forfeit their turn
  -  only be played if your hand contains no other "playable cards"
